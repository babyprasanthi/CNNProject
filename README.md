# CNNProject
This project focuses on the development of a deep learning framework using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect depression from Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Depression is a prevalent mental health condition, and early and accurate detection is critical for effective treatment. Traditional methods rely on subjective assessments, which can be time-consuming and inconsistent.

By leveraging EEG signals—non-invasive recordings of electrical brain activity—this framework aims to identify patterns and biomarkers associated with depressive states. The proposed CNN-based approach extracts spatial and temporal features from raw EEG data to achieve high accuracy in classifying depression.

The project involves:

Data Collection/Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing EEG signals, ensuring quality data for model training.
Feature Extraction: Using CNN layers to automatically extract meaningful features from EEG signals, reducing reliance on manual feature engineering.
Model Design: Developing a CNN architecture optimized for handling EEG data, with layers tailored to capture spatiotemporal patterns.
Training and Validation: Using a labeled dataset to train the CNN and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Integrating the trained model into a practical application, such as a diagnostic tool for clinicians or a mental health monitoring system.
This framework aims to enhance the efficiency and objectivity of depression diagnosis, contributing to advancements in mental health care and neuroscience.
